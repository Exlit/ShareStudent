Student CRUD project (02/2019 â€“ Present)
This UI can add, edit and delete the students. For example teacher can use it for keeping records. In this project my goals are:
to learn how to connect and work with database. I started from jdbc, for better understanding how this connection looks like under the hood. So now i am refactoring code with JPA.
get to know SQL, HTML, JavaScript languages. And learn how to implement their commands inside Intelij idea.
Step by step make an updates, to get nice looking (with css styles) single page UI using hibernate framework.
